# JointJS+ Demo Application - Vue TypeScript Class Style Components

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

The application logic is written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The JointJS library itself is written in JS.

## Project setup

The demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`. Run the following command from the `KitchenSink/VueTs` directory:

```
npm install
```

### Development server

```
npm run serve
```

Compile the application code and start a dev server at `http://localhost:8080/`. The app will automatically hot-reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build for production

```
npm run build
```

Compile the application code and minify it for production. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
