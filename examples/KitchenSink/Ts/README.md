# JointJS+ Demo Application - TypeScript

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

The application logic is written using [TypeScript][https://www.typescriptlang.org/]. The JointJS library itself is written in JS.

## Running the application

A simple HTTP server (requires `Node.js` and `npm`) is part of this demo. Run the following commands from the `KitchenSink/Ts` directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs the TypeScript compilation, bundles the resulting JS files, and starts the web server.
