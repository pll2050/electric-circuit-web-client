# JointJS+ Demo Application - Vue JavaScript

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

The application logic is written using [Vue](https://vuejs.org).

## Running the application

A simple HTTP server (requires `Node.js` and `npm`) is part of this demo. Run the following commands from the `KitchenSink/VueJs` directory:

```
npm install
npm start
```
