# JointJS+ Demo Application - Angular16

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Project setup

The demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`. Run the following command from the `KitchenSink/Angular16` directory:

```
npm install
```

## Development server

```
ng serve
```

Start a dev server at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

```
ng generate component component-name
```

Generate a new component `component-name` in your project. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

ng build
```

Build the project. The build artifacts are stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
