# JointJS+ Demo Application - Vite React Typescript

This application showcases the JointJS+ plugins in action and shows how the plugins
can be combined together. You can use this demo app as a reference for your own application
development.

The application logic is written using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and built with [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/). The JointJS library itself is written in JS.

## Running the application

The demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`. Run the following commands from the `KitchenSink/React/Ts` directory:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
