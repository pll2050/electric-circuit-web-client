# JointJS+ TeamOrder Application Wrapper

Manage the order of team members using this drag and drop editor. Heavily inspired by https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/team-order-shuffler.

## Running the application

Demo requires `Node.js` and `npm`

```
npm install
npm start
```

`npm start` runs the Webpack bundle. Resulted js files are being hosted by webpack-dev-server.

Due to Same-Origin policy implemented in the majority of browsers to prevent content from being accessed if the file exists on another domain, it is recommended to access the application through a **Web server**. The application might work only partially when viewed from a file-system location.
