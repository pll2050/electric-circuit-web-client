# JointJS+ Visio Default Import

Show Microsoft Visio VSDX file inside a JointJS diagram as is.

## Running the application

Due to Same-Origin policy implemented in the majority of browsers to prevent content from being accessed if the file exists on another domain, it is necessary to access the application through a **Web server**. The application might work only partially when viewed from a filesystem location.

A simple HTTP server (requires `Node.js` and `npm`) is part of this demo. To install and start the server, please run `npm install` followed by `npm start` from the `Visio/DefaultImport` directory.
