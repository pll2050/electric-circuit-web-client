# Effects

A various effects (e.g. **highlighters**, **previews**) are defined here. Each effect here has a unique `type` and the default appearance.

Effects can be added or removed to/from a cell view from another part of the application by calling `addEffect()` / `removeEffect()` and specifying the `type` of the effect.
